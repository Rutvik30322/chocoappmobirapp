# Logo Image Setup

## Important: Add Your Logo Image

The CREMIO Chocolate logo component has been integrated into all screens, but you need to add the actual logo image file.

### Steps:
1. Save your CREMIO logo image as `logo.png`
2. Place it in this directory: `app/src/assets/logo.png`
3. The logo should be a PNG file with a transparent background (recommended)
4. Recommended size: At least 200x200 pixels for best quality

### Logo Usage:
- **Login Screen**: Large logo (120px) replacing the emoji
- **Sign Up Screen**: Large logo (120px) replacing the emoji  
- **Forgot Password Screen**: Large logo (120px) replacing the emoji
- **Home Screen Header**: Small logo (40px) next to greeting
- **All Other Screen Headers**: Small logo (30px) next to screen title

The logo component automatically handles sizing and will display once the image file is added.
